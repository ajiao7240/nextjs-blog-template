# Atlas Browser - Verified Facts

## Status: Fictional / Not Real
- OpenAI has NOT released an AI browser named "Atlas"
- No official announcement, blog post, or website exists for "Atlas"
- Multiple reputable tech sources confirm this is a hoax or fictional concept
- No such product appears in OpenAI's official product roadmap

## Origin of Misinformation
- Likely originated from AI-generated fiction or speculative content
- Some AI models have "hallucinated" details about "Atlas" as if it were real
- Common in prompts asking "What if OpenAI built a browser?"

## Related Real Products
- OpenAI's ChatGPT browser extension (real, available)
- Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) - AI integrated into Edge browser
- Google Gemini integration in Chrome

## Key Takeaway
Any "Atlas" browser described as real is misinformation. Writing a blog about it as if real would violate core principles of this workflow.
